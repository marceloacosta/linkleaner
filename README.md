- Make sure you have an active internet connection
- Refresh the LinkedIn page if the extension isn't working

## Important Cost Warning

**This extension makes multiple API calls to OpenAI and will incur charges to your OpenAI account.**

- Each LinkedIn post that gets analyzed results in one API call to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- Costs accumulate based on your LinkedIn usage and the number of posts processed
- A typical LinkedIn browsing session may process dozens of posts
- You are responsible for monitoring and managing your OpenAI usage and costs
- Consider setting usage limits in your OpenAI account to control expenses
- The extension does not include any cost controls or usage limits

**Use this extension at your own responsibility and monitor your OpenAI billing regularly.**

## How It Works

### Architecture Overview

The extension operates using a three-component architecture:

1. **Content Script** (`content.js`) - Runs on LinkedIn pages to detect and process posts
2. **Service Worker** (`worker.js`) - Handles OpenAI API communication in the background
3. **User Interface** (`popup.html/js`, `options.html/js`) - Provides configuration interface

### Content Script Operation

The content script implements several key mechanisms:

**Post Detection**
- Uses `MutationObserver` to watch for new posts added to the DOM
- Employs `IntersectionObserver` to trigger analysis only when posts become visible
- Supports multiple CSS selectors to handle different LinkedIn post layouts
- Implements debouncing to prevent excessive processing

**Text Extraction**
- Extracts post content while filtering out LinkedIn UI elements
- Removes metadata like timestamps, action buttons, and navigation elements
- Handles various post formats including text-only, image posts, and shared content
- Applies minimum character threshold to avoid processing trivial content

**Post Replacement**
- Preserves original post metadata (author, image, timestamp)
- Creates custom UI components with summary and original content toggle
- Implements smooth animations for visual transitions
- Maintains accessibility features and proper DOM structure

### Service Worker Integration

The service worker (`worker.js`) manages all AI processing:

**API Management**
- Handles OpenAI GPT-4o-mini API requests with proper authentication
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests
- Features circuit breaker pattern to prevent excessive API calls during outages
- Manages request timeouts and rate limiting

**Error Handling**
- Distinguishes between different types of API errors (rate limits, server errors, authentication)
- Provides specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Implements automatic recovery mechanisms for transient failures
- Logs detailed error information for debugging

**Performance Features**
- Limits concurrent API requests to prevent overwhelming the service
- Implements request queuing for high-volume scenarios
- Provides fallback responses when API is unavailable
- Monitors API usage patterns and adjusts behavior accordingly

### Configuration System

The extension provides multiple configuration interfaces:

**Options Page** (`options.html/js`)
- Comprehensive settings interface for advanced users
- API key management with secure storage
- Performance tuning parameters
- Debug mode controls and logging options

**Popup Interface** (`popup.html/js`)
- Quick access to basic settings
- Extension status monitoring
- Basic troubleshooting tools
- Direct links to full options page

## Technical Implementation

### DOM Monitoring

The extension uses efficient DOM monitoring strategies:

```javascript
// IntersectionObserver for visibility-based processing
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      processPost(entry.target);
    }
  });
}, { threshold: 0.25 });

// MutationObserver for dynamic content detection
const mutationObserver = new MutationObserver((mutations) => {
  mutations.forEach(mutation => {
    mutation.addedNodes.forEach(scanForPosts);
  });
});
```

### API Integration

The service worker handles API communication with comprehensive error handling:

```javascript
// GPT-4o-mini integration with retry logic
async function generateSummary(text, retryCount = 0) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
      messages: [...],
      max_tokens: 100,
      temperature: 0.8
    })
  });
}
```

### Context Management

The extension implements robust context validation:

- Validates Chrome extension context before operations
- Handles extension invalidation scenarios gracefully
- Implements automatic observer reinitialization
- Provides health monitoring with periodic context checks

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
5. Configure your OpenAI API key in the extension popup
6. Visit LinkedIn to start using the extension

## Configuration

### API Key Setup
The extension requires an OpenAI API key to function. Configure it through the extension popup interface.

### Adjustable Parameters
You can modify these settings in the CONFIG object within content.js:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  debugMode: false,           // Enable detailed logging
  maxConcurrent: 3,          // Maximum simultaneous API requests
  minChars: 30,              // Minimum post length to analyze
  ioThreshold: 0.25          // Intersection threshold for post detection
};
```

## File Structure
